# EMS Pro - Employee Management System (Web Application)

EMS Pro is a responsive, client-side web-based Employee Management System designed to simplify HR operations such as user registration, role-based login, task assignment, and progress tracking — all without a backend server. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and LocalStorage, it supports three types of users: Admin, Manager, and Employee.
